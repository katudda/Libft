# Functions
| Function | Description |
  | ---- | :---- |
  |	ft_atoi	|	Converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by str to int representation	|
  |	ft_bzero	|	Writes n zeroed bytes to the string 's'.	|
  |	ft_calloc	|	Allocates enough space for count objects that are size bytes of memory each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.	|
  |	ft_isalnum	|	Tests for any character for which isalpha(3) or isdigit(3) is true.	|
  |	ft_isalpha	|	Tests for any character for which isupper(3) or islower(3) is true.	|
  |	ft_isascii	|	Tests for an ASCII character.	|
  |	ft_isdigit	|	Tests for a decimal digit character.	|
  |	ft_isprint	|	Tests for any printing character, including space.	|
  |	ft_memccpy	|	Copies bytes from string 'src' to string 'dst'.	|
  |	ft_memchr	|	Locates the first occurrence of 'c' (converted to an unsigned char) in string 's'.	|
  |	ft_memcmp	|	Compares byte string 's1' against byte string 's2'. Both strings are assumed to be n bytes long.	|
  |	ft_memcpy	|	Copies n bytes from memory area 'src' to memory area 'dst'.  If 'dst' and 'src' overlap, behavior is undefined.	|
  |	ft_memmove	|	Copies len bytes from string 'src' to string 'dst'.	|
  |	ft_memset	|	Writes len bytes of value 'c' (converted to an unsigned char) to the string 'b'.	|
  |	ft_strchr	|	Locates the first occurrence of 'c' (converted to a char) in the string pointed to by 's'.	|
  |	ft_strdup	|	Allocates sufficient memory for a copy of the string 's1', does the copy, and returns a pointer to it.	|
  |	ft_strlcat	|	Appends string 'src' to the end of 'dst'.  It will append at most dstsize - strlen(dst) - 1 characters.	|
  |	ft_strlcpy	|	Copies up to dstsize - 1 characters from the string 'src' to 'dst', NUL-terminating the result if dstsize is not 0.	|
  |	ft_strlen	|	Computes the length of the string 's'.	|
  |	ft_strncmp	|	Is designed for comparing strings rather than binary data, characters that appear after a '\0' character are not compared.	|
  |	ft_strnstr	|	Locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string needle in the string haystack, where not more than len characters are searched.	|
  |	ft_strrchr	|	Is identical to strchr(), except it locates the last occurrence of 'c'.	|
  |	ft_tolower	|	Converts an upper-case letter to the corresponding lower-case letter.	|
  |	ft_toupper	|	Converts a lower-case letter to the corresponding upper-case letter.	|
