# Functions
| Function | Description |
  | ---- | :---- |
  |	ft_itoa	|	Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a string representing the integer received as an argument. Negative numbers must be handled.	|
  |	ft_putchar_fd	|	Outputs the character 'c' to the given file	descriptor.	|
  |	ft_putendl_fd	|	Outputs the string 's' to the given file descriptor, followed by a newline.	|
  |	ft_putbnbr_fd	|	Outputs the integer 'n' to the given file descriptor.	|
  |	ft_putstr_fd	|	Outputs the string 's' to the given file descriptor.	|
  |	ft_split	|	Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns an array of strings obtained by splitting 's' using the character 'c' as a delimiter. The array must be ended by a NULL pointer.	|
  |	ft_strjoin	|	Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new string, which is the result of the concatenation of 's1' and 's2'.	|
  |	ft_strmapi	|	Applies the function 'f' to each character of the string 's' to create a new string (with malloc(3)) resulting from successive applications of 'f'.	|
  |	ft_strtrim	|	Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a copy of 's1' with the characters specified in 'set' removed from the beginning and the end of the string.	|
  |	ft_substr	|	Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a substring from the string 's'. The substring begins at index 'start' and is of maximum size 'len'.	|
